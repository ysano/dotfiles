# Development Environment Setup

Complete development environment setup procedures for consistent, productive development workflows.

## 1. Environment Analysis

- Analyze project structure and technology stack
- Identify required development tools and dependencies
- Check existing development environment configuration
- Determine team size and collaboration requirements
- Assess platform requirements (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## 2. Core Tools Installation

- Verify and install required runtime environments (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
- Set up package managers with proper versions (npm, yarn, pnpm, pip, maven)
- Install and configure version control tools (Git, Git LFS)
- Set up code editors with workspace-specific settings (VSCode, IntelliJ)
- Configure terminal and shell environment

## 3. Project-Specific Tooling

- Install project dependencies and dev dependencies
- Set up build tools and task runners
- Configure bundlers and module systems
- Install testing frameworks and runners
- Set up debugging tools and extensions
- Configure profiling and performance monitoring tools

## 4. Code Quality Standards

- Install and configure linting tools (ESLint, Pylint)
- Set up code formatting tools (Prettier, Black)
- Configure pre-commit hooks with Husky or similar
- Set up code spell checking tools
- Configure import sorting and organization
- Set up code complexity and quality metrics

## 5. Development Server and Database

- Set up local development server with hot reloading
- Configure database server and management tools
- Set up containerized development environment (Docker)
- Configure API mocking and testing tools
- Set up local SSL certificates for HTTPS development
- Configure environment variable management

## 6. IDE Configuration

- Configure workspace settings and extensions
- Set up language-specific plugins and syntax highlighting
- Configure IntelliSense and auto-completion
- Set up debugging configurations and breakpoints
- Configure integrated terminal and task running
- Set up code snippets and templates

## 7. Environment Variables and Secrets

- Create .env template files for different environments
- Set up local environment variable management
- Configure secrets management for development
- Set up API keys and service credentials
- Configure environment-specific configuration files
- Document required environment variables

## 8. Documentation and Onboarding

- Create comprehensive setup documentation
- Document common development workflows
- Set up project wiki or knowledge base
- Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Document coding standards and best practices
- Set up onboarding checklist for new team members

## 9. Validation Checklist

- [ ] All tools and dependencies properly installed
- [ ] Development server starts and hot reloading works
- [ ] Database connections and data access validated
- [ ] Build processes and deployment workflows tested
- [ ] Code quality tools working correctly
- [ ] Collaboration workflows and team access verified
- [ ] Development environment health check script created
