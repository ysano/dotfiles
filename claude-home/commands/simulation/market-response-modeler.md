## Quality Indicators

- **Green**: Comprehensive segment analysis, validated response drivers, historical calibration data
- **Yellow**: Good segment coverage, reasonable response assumptions, some validation data
- **Red**: Limited segmentation, unvalidated assumptions, no historical benchmark data

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Segment oversimplification: Using too broad or generic customer categories
- Response uniformity: Assuming all segments respond similarly
- Timing blindness: Not accounting for response timing variations
- Competitive ignorance: Ignoring competitive response dynamics
- Static thinking: Not modeling response evolution over time
- Data bias: Relying on unrepresentative historical data

Transform market uncertainty into strategic advantage through sophisticated response prediction and optimization.
