## Instructions

You are tasked with compressing lengthy real-world timelines into rapid simulation cycles to achieve exponential learning and decision acceleration. Follow this systematic approach: **$ARGUMENTS**

### 1. Prerequisites Assessment

**Critical Timeline Context Validation:**

- **Original Timeline**: What real-world timeline are you trying to compress?
- **Compression Ratio**: How much acceleration do you need (10x, 100x, 1000x)?
- **Key Milestones**: What critical events must be preserved in compression?
- **Decision Points**: What decisions depend on timeline outcomes?
- **Validation Method**: How will you verify compressed timeline accuracy?

**If any context is unclear, guide systematically:**

```
Missing Timeline Context:
"I need to understand the timeline you want to compress:
- Timeline Type: Business cycle, product development, market adoption, competitive response?

```

### 2. Timeline Architecture Analysis

**Systematically map timeline structure and dependencies:**

#### Temporal Structure Mapping
- Sequential dependencies (what must happen in order)
- Parallel workstreams (what can happen simultaneously)
- Critical path identification (bottlenecks and pace-setting activities)
- Milestone definitions (key decision and evaluation points)
- Feedback loops (how later events affect earlier assumptions)

#### Time Dimension Characterization

// ... (8 lines truncated)
```

## Quality Indicators

- **Green**: 10x+ compression ratio, validated historical accuracy, multiple scenario testing
- **Yellow**: 5-10x compression, reasonable accuracy validation, some scenario coverage
- **Red**: <5x compression, limited validation, single scenario focus

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Over-compression: Losing critical real-world constraints and dependencies
- Validation blindness: Not testing compressed predictions against reality
- Context loss: Forgetting that compression is a tool, not an end goal
- Decision rush: Using compression to make premature decisions
- Complexity underestimation: Assuming all timeline elements can be compressed equally
- Single scenario fixation: Not exploring multiple compressed scenarios

Transform your competitor's 3 iterations into your 300 iterations through systematic timeline compression and exponential learning acceleration.
