## Instructions

You are tasked with systematically generating comprehensive future scenarios to explore potential developments and prepare for multiple possible futures. Follow this approach: **$ARGUMENTS**

### 1. Prerequisites Assessment

**Critical Scenario Context Validation:**

- **Time Horizon**: What future timeframe are you exploring (1-3-5-10+ years)?
- **Domain Focus**: What specific area/industry/system are you analyzing?
- **Key Variables**: What factors could significantly shape the future?
- **Decision Impact**: How will these scenarios inform specific decisions?
- **Uncertainty Level**: What's the acceptable range of scenario uncertainty?

**If context is unclear, guide systematically:**

```
Missing Time Horizon:
"What future timeframe should we explore?
- Near-term (1-2 years): Market shifts, competitive moves, technology adoption

```

### 2. Trend Analysis Foundation

**Systematically analyze current trends as scenario building blocks:**

#### Trend Identification Framework
```
Multi-Dimensional Trend Analysis:

Technology Trends:
// ... (23 lines truncated)
```

#### Trend Trajectory Modeling
- Linear progression scenarios (current trends continue)
- Acceleration scenarios (trends speed up dramatically)
- Deceleration scenarios (trends slow down or plateau)
- Reversal scenarios (trends change direction)
- Disruption scenarios (trends are fundamentally altered)

### 3. Scenario Architecture Design

**Structure comprehensive scenario frameworks:**

#### Scenario Generation Methodology

```

### 4. Plausibility Assessment Framework

**Systematically evaluate scenario credibility:**

#### Plausibility Scoring Methodology
```
Multi-Criteria Plausibility Assessment:

Historical Precedent (25% weight):
// ... (21 lines truncated)
```

#### Uncertainty Quantification
- Confidence intervals for key scenario parameters
- Sensitivity analysis for critical assumptions
- Monte Carlo simulation for probability distributions
- Expert elicitation for subjective probability assessment

### 5. Wild Card and Disruption Modeling

**Incorporate low-probability, high-impact events:**

#### Wild Card Event Framework
```
Systematic Disruption Analysis:

Technology Wild Cards:
// ... (23 lines truncated)
```

#### Disruption Impact Modeling
- Direct impact assessment on key scenario variables
- Cascade effect analysis through system dependencies
- Adaptation and recovery scenario development
- Resilience and vulnerability analysis

### 6. Scenario Integration and Synthesis

**Combine scenarios into comprehensive future landscape:**

#### Cross-Scenario Analysis
```
Scenario Portfolio Analysis:

Scenario Clustering:
// ... (17 lines truncated)
```

#### Scenario Narrative Development
- Compelling future stories that integrate multiple trends
- Character and stakeholder perspective integration
- Timeline development and milestone identification
- Vivid details that make scenarios memorable and actionable

### 7. Decision Integration Framework

**Connect scenarios to actionable strategic insights:**

#### Strategy Testing Against Scenarios
```
Scenario-Based Strategy Evaluation:

Strategy Robustness Analysis:
// ... (17 lines truncated)
```

#### Strategic Recommendation Generation
```
Scenario-Informed Strategy Framework:

## Future Scenario Analysis: [Domain/Project Name]
// ... (35 lines truncated)
```

### 8. Continuous Scenario Evolution

**Establish ongoing scenario refinement and updating:**

#### Real-World Validation
- Track actual developments against scenario predictions
- Update scenario probabilities based on emerging evidence
- Refine scenario assumptions based on real-world feedback
- Learn from scenario accuracy and prediction quality

#### Adaptive Scenario Management
- Regular scenario refresh and update cycles
- New information integration and scenario modification
- Stakeholder feedback incorporation and perspective updates
- Methodology improvement based on scenario performance

## Usage Examples

```bash
/simulation:future-scenario-generator Generate scenarios for AI's impact on healthcare industry over next 10 years

# Technology adoption scenarios
// ... (8 lines truncated)
```

## Quality Indicators

- **Green**: Diverse scenario portfolio, validated plausibility scores, integrated wild cards
- **Yellow**: Good scenario variety, reasonable plausibility assessment, some disruption modeling
- **Red**: Limited scenario diversity, unvalidated assumptions, missing disruption analysis

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Present bias: Projecting current conditions too strongly into the future
- Linear thinking: Assuming trends continue unchanged without acceleration or disruption
- Probability illusion: Being overconfident in specific scenario likelihoods
- Complexity underestimation: Not modeling interaction effects between trends
- Wild card blindness: Ignoring low-probability, high-impact events
- Action paralysis: Generating scenarios without connecting to decisions

Transform uncertainty into strategic advantage through systematic future scenario exploration and preparation.
