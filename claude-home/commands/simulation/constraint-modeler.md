## Instructions

You are tasked with systematically modeling the constraints that govern your decision environment to create accurate simulations and scenarios. Follow this approach: **$ARGUMENTS**

### 1. Prerequisites Assessment

**Critical Constraint Context Validation:**

- **Domain Definition**: What system/environment are you modeling constraints for?
- **Constraint Types**: Physical, economic, regulatory, technical, or social constraints?
- **Impact Scope**: How do these constraints affect decisions and outcomes?
- **Change Dynamics**: Are constraints static or do they evolve over time?
- **Validation Sources**: What data/expertise can verify constraint accuracy?

**If context is unclear, guide systematically:**

```
Missing Domain Context:
"I need to understand what you're modeling constraints for:
- Business Domain: Market constraints, competitive dynamics, regulatory environment

```

### 2. Constraint Taxonomy Framework

**Systematically categorize and structure constraints:**

#### Hard Constraints (Cannot be violated)
```
Physical/Natural Constraints:
- Laws of physics and natural limitations
- Geographic and spatial boundaries
// ... (15 lines truncated)
```

#### Soft Constraints (Can be managed/traded off)
```
Economic Constraints:
- Budget limitations and financial resources
- Cost optimization and efficiency targets
// ... (15 lines truncated)
```

#### Dynamic Constraints (Change over time)
```
Evolutionary Constraints:
- Technology advancement and obsolescence cycles
- Market maturation and customer evolution
// ... (9 lines truncated)
```

### 3. Constraint Mapping and Visualization

**Create comprehensive constraint relationship models:**

#### Constraint Interaction Matrix

#### Constraint Hierarchy Modeling
- Strategic level constraints (mission, vision, values)
- Tactical level constraints (resources, capabilities, market position)
- Operational level constraints (processes, systems, daily operations)
- Individual level constraints (skills, capacity, availability)

### 4. Assumption Validation Framework

**Systematically test and validate constraint assumptions:**

#### Assumption Documentation
```
Constraint Assumption Template:

Constraint: [Name and description]
// ... (16 lines truncated)
```

#### Historical Validation

- Comparison of assumed vs. actual constraint limits
- Pattern recognition for constraint evolution and change
- Case study analysis from similar environments and decisions

#### Real-time Validation

- Early warning systems for constraint violation risks
- Feedback loops from constraint testing and boundary pushing
- Expert consultation and stakeholder validation

### 5. Scenario Boundary Definition

**Use constraints to define realistic scenario limits:**

#### Feasible Scenario Space
```
Scenario Constraint Boundaries:

Optimistic Boundary:

```

#### Constraint Stress Testing
- Maximum constraint load scenarios and breaking points

```

#### Adaptive Constraint Management
- Constraint monitoring and early warning systems
- Proactive constraint modification and optimization
- Scenario adaptation for changing constraint conditions
- Strategic planning for anticipated constraint evolution

### 7. Constraint Optimization Strategies

**Generate approaches to work within and optimize constraints:**

#### Constraint Relaxation Approaches
```

```

#### Creative Constraint Solutions
- Constraint reframing and alternative perspective development
- Innovative approaches that turn constraints into advantages
- Synergistic solutions that address multiple constraints simultaneously
- Constraint-inspired innovation and creative problem solving

### 8. Output Generation and Documentation

**Present constraint analysis in actionable format:**

```
## Constraint Model Analysis: [Domain/Project Name]

### Constraint Environment Overview
// ... (46 lines truncated)
```

### 9. Continuous Constraint Learning

**Establish ongoing constraint model improvement:**

#### Feedback Integration
- Actual constraint behavior vs. model predictions
- Constraint violation lessons and recovery insights
- Stakeholder feedback on constraint accuracy and completeness
- Market and environment changes affecting constraint validity

#### Model Enhancement
- Constraint model accuracy improvement over time
- New constraint identification and integration
- Constraint relationship refinement and optimization
- Predictive capability enhancement for constraint evolution

## Usage Examples

```bash
/simulation:constraint-modeler Model market entry constraints for European expansion including regulatory, competitive, and resource limitations

# Technical architecture constraints  
// ... (8 lines truncated)
```

## Quality Indicators

- **Green**: Comprehensive constraint coverage, validated assumptions, dynamic modeling
- **Yellow**: Good constraint identification, some validation, basic change modeling
- **Red**: Limited constraint coverage, unvalidated assumptions, static modeling

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Constraint blindness: Not identifying hidden or implicit constraints
- Static thinking: Treating dynamic constraints as fixed limitations
- Over-constraint: Adding unnecessary restrictions that limit options
- Under-validation: Not testing constraint assumptions against reality
- Isolation thinking: Not modeling constraint interactions and dependencies
- Solution bias: Defining constraints to justify preferred solutions

Transform limitations into strategic clarity through systematic constraint modeling and optimization.
