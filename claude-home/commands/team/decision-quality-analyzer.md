## Instructions

You are tasked with systematically analyzing and improving team decision quality through scenario analysis, bias detection, and process optimization. Follow this approach: **$ARGUMENTS**

### 1. Decision Context Assessment

**Critical Decision Quality Context:**

- **Decision Type**: What category of decision are you analyzing?
- **Decision Process**: How does the team currently make this type of decision?
- **Stakeholders**: Who participates in and is affected by these decisions?
- **Success Metrics**: How do you measure decision quality and outcomes?
- **Historical Data**: What past decisions provide learning opportunities?

**If context is unclear, guide systematically:**

```
Missing Decision Type:
"What type of team decision needs quality analysis?
- Strategic Decisions: Product direction, market positioning, technology choices

### 2. Decision Quality Framework

**Systematic decision evaluation methodology:**

#### Quality Dimension Assessment

```

#### Decision Success Metrics
- Quantitative outcomes (financial, operational, performance metrics)
- Qualitative outcomes (satisfaction, engagement, strategic alignment)
- Process efficiency (time to decision, resource utilization)
- Learning outcomes (knowledge gained, capability developed)

### 3. Bias Detection and Mitigation

**Systematic cognitive bias identification:**

### 4. Scenario-Based Decision Testing

**Test decision quality through hypothetical scenarios:**

#### Decision Scenario Framework
```
Comprehensive Decision Testing:

```

#### Simulation-Based Improvement
- Role-playing exercises for complex decision scenarios
- Process experimentation with low-stakes decisions
- A/B testing of different decision methodologies
- Scenario planning for future decision situations

### 5. Team Decision Process Optimization

**Systematic improvement of decision-making workflows:**

#### Process Enhancement Framework
```
Decision Process Optimization:

Information Management:

```

#### Team Capability Building
- Decision-making skill training and development
- Process facilitation and meeting effectiveness
- Critical thinking and analytical capability enhancement
- Communication and stakeholder management improvement

### 6. Output Generation and Recommendations

**Present decision quality insights in actionable format:**

```

```

### 7. Continuous Learning Integration

**Establish ongoing decision quality improvement:**

#### Decision Outcome Tracking
- Systematic monitoring of decision results and impacts
- Correlation analysis between process quality and outcomes
- Pattern recognition for successful vs unsuccessful decisions
- Feedback integration for process refinement and enhancement

#### Organizational Learning
- Best practice identification and knowledge sharing
- Decision case study development and team learning
- Cross-functional learning and capability transfer
- Industry benchmark comparison and competitive analysis

## Usage Examples

```bash
/team:decision-quality-analyzer Analyze product roadmap prioritization decisions for bias and process improvement opportunities

# Technical architecture decision assessment
// ... (8 lines truncated)
```

## Quality Indicators

- **Green**: Comprehensive bias analysis, validated process improvements, outcome tracking
- **Yellow**: Basic bias recognition, some process enhancement, limited outcome measurement
- **Red**: Minimal bias awareness, ad-hoc process, no systematic improvement

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Analysis paralysis: Over-analyzing decisions instead of improving decision-making
- Bias blindness: Not recognizing team and organizational cognitive biases
- Process rigidity: Creating inflexible procedures that slow appropriate decisions
- Outcome fixation: Judging process quality only by outcomes rather than methodology
- Individual focus: Ignoring group dynamics and organizational factors
- One-size-fits-all: Using same process for all decision types and contexts

Transform team decision-making from intuition-based guessing into systematic, evidence-driven capability that creates sustainable competitive advantage.
