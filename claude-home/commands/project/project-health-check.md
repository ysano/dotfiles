## 実行手順

1. **Health Check Initialization**
   - Verify tool connections (Linear, GitHub)
   - Define evaluation period (default: last 30 days)
   - Set health check criteria and thresholds
   - Identify key metrics to evaluate

2. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**

#### Code Health Metrics
```bash
git log --format=format: --name-only --since="30 days ago" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rg

# Contributor activity
git shortlog -sn --since="30 days ago"

# Branch health
git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(committerdate:relative)' refs/heads/ | grep -E "(months|years) ago"

# File complexity (if cloc available)
cloc . --json --exclude-dir=node_modules,dist,build

# Test coverage trends
npm test -- --coverage --json
```

#### Dependency Health
```bash
# Check for outdated dependencies
npm outdated --json

# Security vulnerabilities
npm audit --json

# License compliance
npx license-checker --json
```

#### Linear/Task Management Health
```
1. Sprint velocity trends
2. Cycle time analysis
3. Blocked task duration
4. Backlog growth rate
5. Bug vs feature ratio
6. Task completion predictability
```

#### Team Health Indicators
```
1. PR review turnaround time
2. Commit frequency distribution
3. Work distribution balance
4. On-call incident frequency
5. Documentation updates
```

```

4. **Interactive Deep Dives**

Offer focused analysis options:

```
"Based on the health check, would you like to:
1. Deep dive into declining velocity trends
2. Generate security vulnerability fix plan
3. Analyze technical debt hotspots
4. Create team workload rebalancing plan
5. Set up automated health monitoring"
```

## Error Handling

### Missing Linear Connection
```
"Linear MCP not connected. Health check will be limited to:
- Git/GitHub metrics only
- No sprint velocity or task metrics
- Manual input required for team data

To enable full health analysis:
1. Install Linear MCP server
2. Configure with API credentials
3. Re-run health check"
```

### Incomplete Data
```
"Some metrics could not be calculated:
- [List missing metrics]
- [Explain impact on analysis]

Would you like to:
1. Proceed with available data
2. Manually provide missing information
3. Skip incomplete sections"
```

## Customization Options

### Threshold Configuration
```yaml
# health-check-config.yml
thresholds:
  velocity_variance: 20  # Acceptable % variance
  test_coverage: 80      # Minimum coverage %
  pr_review_time: 4      # Maximum hours
  bug_rate: 5           # Maximum % of work
  dependency_age: 90    # Days before "outdated"
```

### Custom Health Metrics
Allow users to define additional metrics:
```
"Add custom health metric:
- Name: Customer Satisfaction
- Data Source: [API/Manual/File]
- Target Value: [>4.5/5]
- Weight: [Impact on overall score]"
```

## Export Options

1. **Executive Summary** (PDF/Markdown)
2. **Detailed Report** (HTML with charts)
3. **Raw Metrics** (JSON/CSV)
4. **Action Items** (Linear tasks/GitHub issues)
5. **Monitoring Dashboard** (Grafana/Datadog format)

## Automation Suggestions

```
"Would you like me to:
1. Schedule weekly health checks
2. Set up alerts for critical metrics
3. Create Linear tasks for action items
4. Generate PR templates with health criteria
5. Configure CI/CD health gates"
```

## ベストプラクティス

1. **Regular Cadence**: Run health checks weekly/bi-weekly
2. **Track Trends**: Compare with historical data
3. **Action-Oriented**: Focus on fixable issues
4. **Team Involvement**: Share results transparently
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Refine metrics based on outcomes
