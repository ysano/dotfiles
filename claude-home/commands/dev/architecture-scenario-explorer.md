## Instructions

You are tasked with systematically exploring architectural decisions through comprehensive scenario modeling to optimize system design choices. Follow this approach: **$ARGUMENTS**

### 1. Prerequisites Assessment

**Critical Architecture Context Validation:**

- **System Scope**: What system or component architecture are you designing?
- **Scale Requirements**: What are the expected usage patterns and growth projections?
- **Constraints**: What technical, business, or resource constraints apply?
- **Timeline**: What is the implementation timeline and evolution roadmap?
- **Success Criteria**: How will you measure architectural success?

**If context is unclear, guide systematically:**

### Context and Problem Statement
// ... (38 lines truncated)
```

### 9. Continuous Architecture Evolution

**Establish ongoing architectural assessment and improvement:**

#### Architecture Health Monitoring
- Performance metric tracking against architectural predictions
- Technical debt accumulation and remediation planning
- Team productivity and development velocity measurement
- User satisfaction and business outcome correlation

#### Evolutionary Architecture Practices
- Regular architecture review and fitness function evaluation
- Incremental improvement identification and implementation
- Technology trend assessment and adoption planning
- Cross-team architecture knowledge sharing and standardization

## Usage Examples

```bash
/dev:architecture-scenario-explorer Evaluate monolith to microservices migration for e-commerce platform with 1M+ users

# New system architecture design
// ... (8 lines truncated)
```

## Quality Indicators

- **Green**: Multiple architectures analyzed, comprehensive scenarios tested, validated trade-offs
- **Yellow**: Some architectural options considered, basic scenario coverage, estimated trade-offs
- **Red**: Single architecture focus, limited scenario analysis, unvalidated assumptions

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Architecture astronauting: Over-engineering for theoretical rather than real requirements
- Cargo cult architecture: Copying successful patterns without understanding context
- Technology bias: Choosing architecture based on technology preferences rather than requirements
- Premature optimization: Solving performance problems that don't exist yet
- Scalability obsession: Over-optimizing for scale that may never materialize
- Evolution blindness: Not planning for architectural change and growth

Transform architectural decisions from opinion-based debates into systematic, evidence-driven choices through comprehensive scenario exploration and trade-off analysis.
