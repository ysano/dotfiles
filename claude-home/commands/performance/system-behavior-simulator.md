## Quality Indicators

- **Green**: Comprehensive load modeling, validated bottleneck analysis, quantified optimization strategies
- **Yellow**: Good load coverage, basic bottleneck identification, estimated optimization benefits
- **Red**: Limited load scenarios, unvalidated bottlenecks, qualitative-only optimization suggestions

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Load unrealism: Testing with artificial patterns that don't match real usage
- Bottleneck tunnel vision: Focusing on single constraints while ignoring others
- Optimization premature: Optimizing for problems that don't exist yet
- Capacity under-planning: Not accounting for growth and traffic spikes
- Monitoring blindness: Not establishing ongoing performance visibility
- Cost ignorance: Optimizing performance without considering budget constraints

Transform system performance from reactive firefighting into proactive, data-driven optimization through comprehensive behavior simulation and capacity planning.
